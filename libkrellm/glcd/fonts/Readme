Steps to add a font to the ukrellm glcd library.
-----------------------------------------------

1) Get or generate a .bdf font file of the font you want, here use the
9x15.bdf font from X11 as an example.

2) If you want to reduce the font size to a minimum to conserve memory space,
Edit the 9x15.bdf file to remove glyphs before the 'space' and after the
'tilde'.  There should be 95 chars remaining in the font, so change the
CHARS line in the 9x15.bdf file to be 95.  Check this by running:

		$ grep STARTCHAR 9x15.bdf | wc


3) Run bdf2c on the .bdf file to generate the C file font.c.  I have modified
bdf2c (original from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bdf2c/) to output a
font.c file in a format suitable for the ukrellm glcd library.
Give the font a C name "font_9x15" to be referenced in your code..

		$ bdf2c -n font_9x15 -b < 9x15.bdf > 9x15.c

If the 9x15.bdf file was not edited to make 'space' the first character,
then you will need to edit the 9x15.c file and correctly initialize the
"first_char" in the font_9x15 structure declaration at the bottom of the file.

4) Make the "font_9x15" name visible to code in the glcd library.
	Edit glcd-fonts.h and add the line:

		extern GlcdFont	font_9x15;

5) Make the 9x15.c file visible to make so it will be compiled.
Add a target to cSRCS_$(d) in rules.mk in the libglcd directory:

cSRCS_$(d) :=  fonts/shadow-bold.c \
               fonts/9x15.c

5) Now your application can access the font, E.g.

		GlcdFont *font = &font_9x15;
