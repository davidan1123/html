glcd library
============

I originally wrote this glcd library to drive SPI LCDs connected to
my Raspberry Pi adapter PCB and my STM32 project PCBs.  For PiKrellCam,
I added a simple I420 driver for drawing overlays on the camera mjpeg stream.

The libkrellm directory organization here is structured for linking to
my Raspberry Pi programs.  For the purpose of distributing the PiKrellCam
program, other programs and libkrellm libraries have been removed to
avoid stuff not necessary for PiKrellCam.

When compiling for an I420 only program such as PiKrellCam, wiringPi
is not required and -D HAVE_WIRINGPI should not be defined.

If compiled to use the ili9341 driver, the Makefile must have a
-D HAVE_WIRINGPI define as a compiler argument and the final link
must include -lwiringPi


Features
--------
Draw areas with clipping - tiled drawing areas can be created and graphics
    drawing primitives will clip to the draw areas.

Widgets - Buttons, sliders and titled windows.

Fonts - easy to add standard .bdf fonts.

When using the ili9341 driver, colors can be selected using standard
    X11 color names.  The I420 driver color uses only YUV intensity and
    does not touch the UV.

TODO
----
	Add other controllers.
	Auto detect LCD model if possible.
	I420 UV color.
